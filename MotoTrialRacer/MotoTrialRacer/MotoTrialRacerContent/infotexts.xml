Playing Moto Trial Racer

The Goal is to get the motorcycle and the
driver to the chequered flag as fast as
possible. The game ends if any part of
the motorcycle or player touches the
spikes or the player's head touches any
other object. When the player gets to
the chequered flag fast enough, he/she
gets his/her name and time to the high
scores list. The game can be paused,
restarted and exited at any time via the
options menu.

Controls

The motorcycle is accelerated by leaning
the device towards the player and
braked by leaning the device away from
the player. The center of mass can be
moved backwards/forwards by pressing the
arrow buttons in top of the screen.

Level Editor

New objects can be added by pressing the
object buttons in top of the screen. After
a new object is added, it can be dragged
to any position. An active object can be
rotated by using two fingers. When the
level is completed, it can be named and saved.
The custom levels can be deleted by pressing
and holding a level button down for two seconds.
